# Simple JBot
A configurable and easy to use bot for chat enviroments in social platforms. As of this writing it only supports communication with ![Twitch](https://img.shields.io/badge/Twitch-%239146FF.svg?style=for-the-badge&logo=Twitch&logoColor=white) . The configuration is done through a simple json. This is a side project of mine mostly for learning purposes and good fun during my free time .


## Build (Maven)
Either in your IDE of choice or in the project folder execute the following commands:
- `mvn install clean package`
- `java -jar SJBot.jar `
